- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JohayerChowdury!
- ðŸ‘€ I graduated from the University of Waterloo with a Bachelor's Degree in Management Engineering / Computing Option. 
      I'm interested in building computer programs and information systems 
      as well as applying business concepts in the real world.
- :office_worker: I've worked in multiple fields and industries, spanning from software development in tech start-ups to strategy and project management at large insurance firms.
- :pushpin: I'm currently looking for entry-level and associate positions using frontend frameworks such as React.js and backend languages such as Python to build full-stack features for client-facing SaaS.
